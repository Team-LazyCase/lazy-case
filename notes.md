# Dev Environment
## How To Use Clasp
### "clasp push" Command
Deploy the code to the Apps Script repository.

### "clasp push -w" Command
The "-w" stands for watch so that any time you make a change, that change is 
deployed to the Apps Script repository. This way, you don't have to use "clasp
push" every time you make a change. 

### The .claspignore File
This file is used to ignore the prototypes we made when developing the MVP.
