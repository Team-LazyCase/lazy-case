## Objective

Build a Google Docs Add-on that formats the document's titles and paragraph headers to title case. This add-on supports title case stylings for MLA, AP, and Chicago.

## What is the problem?

The built-in functionality of Google Docs is extremely limited when it comes to title case formatting: it will automatically capitalize all first letters, which is not proper title case. Existing add-ons that deal with this problem are less than ideal, with ratings of less that 3 stars and plenty of complaints. We want to spend our time writing, not tediously formatting titles and headers manually or with one-string-at-a-time converter tools.
